# MovieList

This project lists popular movies with pagination that you can go detail page with selected movie. I have used Swift language and MVVM architecture to develop this project.
In the main page I have collection view to list movies both list or grid. Also you can filter fetched movies with search bar in the navigation bar. You will see movie poster, title, overview, release date and favorite button of movie when go to detail page. I have used UserDefaults to save movie as favorite.
